# JavaScript Dice Game - (Pig)

### Playing the game
- Two players take turns playing in rounds.
- In a round, the player rolls a single die as many times as they wish, with the sum of their results becoming their score for that round.
- If the player rolls a 1, then their score for that round goes to 0 and the other player takes a turn.
- At any point in time, the current play may choose to hold, which adds their round score to their total score, and play passes to the other player.
- The first player whose total score reaches 100 wins the game.
